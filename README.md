# Mathematical models in Neuroscience

Consider a system of differential equations that describes the translation
of a point mass in the plane. There are two control values: $u_x$ which produces
a force in the $x$ dimension and $u_y$ which produces a force in the $y$ dimension.
There are also external forces, $F_{x,E}$ and $F_{y,E}$ that can push the system as
when a perturbation is applied to it. We want to erive an LQG control model in the fully observable case.
